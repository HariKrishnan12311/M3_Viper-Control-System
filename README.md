Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.

A wiper speed control system for an automobile wiper regulates the operating speed of a wiper in accordance with the amount of rain falling on the windshield. This is a very much essential component in each automobile as it avoids the risk of accidents during rainy conditions.
